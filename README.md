# ctt-executable
This is an executable file for Chris Titus' Tool. All it is, is just a .ps1 file that automatically runs `iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex` in administrator mode. I only made this because I'm lazy and it got kinda annoying to constantly run powershell in adminstrator and paste in the command or clicking the original .exe and running it as administrator.

If you're coming here and haven't already, please support the folks who contribute to `winutil` at https://cttstore.com/products/windows-toolbox. They're doing amazing work and there really isn't another service quite as good as their's.
To Mr. Titus Tech, I am very very sorry for essentially pirating the 10$ .exe wrapper from your website. Please forgive me üôè.

To install the executable you can either directly install the file form here or download `install-ctt.ps1` and run it. Once you do the latter, it should appear on your desktop (ik it's pretty redundant to have this, I only really made this so that one of my liteOS's always boots up with CTT ready to go).
