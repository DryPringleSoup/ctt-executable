# ctt-executable
This is an executable file for Chris Titus' Tool. All it is, is just a .ps1 file that automatically runs `iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex` in administrator mode. I only made this because I'm lazy and it got kinda annoying to constantly run powershell in adminstrator and paste in the command or clicking the original .exe and running it as administrator.

If you're coming here and haven't already, please support the folks who contribute to `winutil` at https://cttstore.com/products/windows-toolbox. They're doing amazing work and there really isn't another service quite as good as their's. And to Mr. Titus Tech, I am very very sorry for essentially bootlegging the 10$ .exe wrapper from your website. Please forgive me üôè.

To install the executable you can either directly download the file from here or download and run `CTT-installer.exe` (ik it's pretty redundant to have this, I only really made this so that one of my liteOS's always boots up on a new setup with CTT ready to go). If you do the latter option, it should appear on your desktop.
