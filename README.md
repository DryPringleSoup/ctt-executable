# ctt-executable
This is an executable file for Chris Titus' Tool. All it is, is just a .ps1 file that automatically runs `iwr -useb https://christitus.com/win | iex` in administrator mode. I only made this because I'm lazy and it got kinda annoying to constantly run powershell in adminstrator and paste in the command. And to Mr. Titus Tech, I am very very sorry for essentially pirating the 10$ .exe wrapper from your website. Please forgive me üôè

To install the executable you can either directly install the file form here or download `install-ctt.ps1` and run it. Once you do the latter, it should appear on your desktop (ik it's pretty redundant to have this, I only really made this so that one of my litOs' always boots up with CTT ready to go).
